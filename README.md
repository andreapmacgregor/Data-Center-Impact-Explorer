# Data Center Impact Explorer

*Drexel University MS in Data Science Capstone I*

A data science capstone project analyzing the relationship between data centers and surrounding communities across the United States and investigating the potential impacts of data center development on local areas.

The project integrates multiple public datasets with data from the the FracTracker Alliance U.S. Data Centers Tracker to explore factors that may influence where data centers are built and existing conditions or issues within the surrounding areas that could potentially be exacerbated by data center development.

## Project Objectives

This project explores several research questions related to data center development, including the following:

- Data centers have a high water demand; are they located in areas already prone to drought, when they might pose additional strain? 
- Data centers also have high electricity demand; what are the conditions for electricity production and pricing where they are located? 
- Data centers produce pollution that can cause or exacerbate certain health conditions; what are the existing health concerns in local communities that could be aggravated?
- Local governments play a role in data center siting in terms of zoning, permitting, and incentives; what are the political conditions in areas with data centers?

## Data Sources

The project combines several publicly available datasets, as follows. 

### Data on Data Centers

* [FracTracker Alliance U.S. Data Centers Tracker](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/5a4d072ad01449bba5698a80103fb909/page/About): Contains over 1,500 individual data centers in the U.S. with their precision locations and additional information. The data is allowed to be downloaded, shared, and used as long as proper credit is given to FracTracker. <mark>Should we include this data in the repository or not?</mark>

### Data on Drought

* [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/):
The U.S. Drought Monitor is updated weekly with drought data collected across the United States. This data is allowed to be reproduced when this citation is used: 
The U.S. Drought Monitor is jointly produced by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the United States Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

### Data on Electricity

* <mark>Add here - note source(s), reuse permissions, whether data is reposted in this repository</mark>

### Data on Health

* <mark>Add here - note source(s), reuse permissions, whether data is reposted in this repository</mark>

### Data on Politics

* [National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA) (ICPSR 38506)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/38506#): Voter registration, turnout, and partisanship by county in the U.S. from 2004 to 2022. The data is public access as a TSV within a downloadable zip file with accompanying documentation, but requires having or making an account to download; redistribution of this dataset is not permitted, so the data is not included in this repository. 
* [American Local Government Elections Database](https://osf.io/mv5e6/overview): Local election results at the city and county level from 1989 to 2021. The data is open access under the CC-By Attribution 4.0 International license. This data was explored in `Inspection Data Center and Politics.ipynb` and `Preprocessing politics.ipynb` but ultimately found to not be comprehensive enough for our project goals, and so is not included in this repository.

### Supporting Data 

* [RowZero FIPS code lists and location mapping](https://rowzero.com/datasets/fips-codes-lookup) (specifically sheet titled “Zip to County”): Provides conversion from ZIP code to FIPS code, which is necessary for joining on location between e.g. the data center data and political data. This dataset is free to use but requires a Row Zero account to download, and so is not reposted in this repository.
